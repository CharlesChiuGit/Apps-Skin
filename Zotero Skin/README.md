- Watch the [full tutorial ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325828616_Tutorial_The_Best_Reference_Manager_Setup_Zotero_ZotFile_Cloud_Storage) by [Stephen Chignell](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Chignell).
- Noted: the **engines.json** he provided was invalid, use this [engines.json](https://github.com/bwiernik/zotero-tools/blob/master/engines.json) by [bwiernik](https://github.com/bwiernik) instead.
- Noted: the **FireTray** plugin seems to be outdated and doesn't work on _Win10 21H2 19044.1526_. Correct me if I'm wrong.
- Other plugins' repo: [Zutilo](https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo/releases), [Zotero Scholar Citations](https://github.com/beloglazov/zotero-scholar-citations/raw/master/builds/zotero-scholar-citations-1.9.3-fx.xpi) and [Zotero Storage Scanner](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-storage-scanner/releases/)
